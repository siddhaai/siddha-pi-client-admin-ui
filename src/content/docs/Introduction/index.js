              We've built this template with performance in mind, so all pages
              will get a 96 or more score on Google Lighthouse performance
              testing. You can inspect the template performance by opening the
              Google Chrome Inspector and moving to the last tab named
              "Lighthouse". On that tab click on "Generate report".
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              We designed multiple color schemes that can be switched from the
              Settings button in the live preview screen corner.
